# Computer-Vision-Homography-and-Uses-
We will learn how to find a homography and explore its uses. 
We compare our homography function against findHomography from OpenCv.
We compute a homography that maps 2 images using DLT. 
Then we straighten an image using homography. 
Using the code in the above exercise to find a homography that ‘straightens’ image1 as follows: we are given
that the aspect ratio (width/height) of the book is 30/23. We mark and store the 4 corner points of the book in
image1; choose 4 points in the destination image that we will map the chosen points to (keeping the aspect
ratio in mind). Then compute the homography and apply it to image1. The resulting image should be akin
to what is seen in image3.
In the end we list 2 different use cases of homography and showcase them.
